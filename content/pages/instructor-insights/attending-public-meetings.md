One of the biggest reforms in transportation planning has come from the requirements for public meetings. These meetings force proponents of transportation projects to explain why they make sense to the public. Observing that process is important and informative, and you don’t get a feel for it unless you’ve gone to some of the meetings and seen how they work.

It’s a matter of luck if there happen to be hearings that are interesting during a given semester; if there are, indeed, relevant hearings while we’re in class, I’ll call attention to them. In the Fall 2016 iteration of the course, I encouraged students to go to the meetings convened by MIT about the [Institute’s purchase of the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center](http://news.mit.edu/2017/agreement-redevelop-volpe-center-kendall-square-0118) in Kendall Square and what that means for the MIT community. They’re MIT students; they should know what the Institute is proposing. It’s not a very good plan. I’ve written [articles in the faculty newsletter](http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/293/salvucci.html) saying so.
